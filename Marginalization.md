# Marginalization

Process of removing unimporant variables from a function for example see below

$f_k(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)= \prod _{n=1}^{5}f_n(x_n)$ , then $\bar{f_k}(x_5) = \prod _{n=1}^{4}(\sum _{x_n}f_n(x_n)) \cdot f_5(x_5)$

basically its the process of adding up all the problilites for the other variables which you're not intrested in.
