# Parallel RRTs for Multi-Robotic Systems

#RobotPathPlanning for [[Multi-Robotic]] Systems using RRTs [[Sampling Based Path Planning]] in parralel mode to improve the speed

## Parallel Formulation of RRTs
### BiDirectional RRT

#### OR parallel RRT
Here a set of processors are tasked with the same problem of finding the solution they terminate if they find a solution to the problem.

### Embarsingly Parallel RRT

## Notes
1) Looks like this is very old paper but idea is promissing
